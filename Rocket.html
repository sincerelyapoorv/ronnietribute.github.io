          <h1>Ronnie O’Sullivan wins record-equalling seventh world title</h1>
          <p>
            Ronnie O’Sullivan claims his seventh world title after beating Judd
            Trump 18-13 at the World Championship final on Monday. The Rocket
            has equalled the record set by Stephen Hendry, who reached seven
            world titles in 1999.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a lead of 12-5 after the Sunday sessions, it seemed that
            O’Sullivan would clinch the title as soon as he arrived at the
            Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. However, it was not that easy.
            <br />
            <br />
            Trump fought back and managed to shorten O’Sullivan’s lead,
            finishing the afternoon session with 14-11. O’Sullivan had a lead of
            three frames before the evening session.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Rocket came back to the last session at full force. With breaks
            of 82, 85, 75 and 85, O’Sullivan ends triumphant and wins another
            Crucible title. At 46-years-old, Ronnie O'Sullivan also became the
            oldest world champion in the Crucible history.
            <br />
            <br />
            “I tried to be as relaxed as I could, but that is probably the
            greatest result I’ve had against somebody like Judd [Trump]. Said
            O’Sullivan.
            <br />
            <br />
            “I’ve never bothered about records. When you get them, it’s kind of
            nice. I don’t have targets. I’ve loved every tournament this year,
            I’ve just loved playing.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wt-col">
          <img src="./CSS/Media/Images/image-ronnie.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            After winning, O’Sullivan suggested he would be back in Sheffield
            next year to fully break the record, joking that he would “share it
            [the record] for a year” with Hendry.
            <br />
            <br />
            Even though Trump ended up on the losing side, he could not hide his
            admiration for O’Sullivan sharing how delightful it was to share a
            table with The Rocket.
            <br />
            <br />
            "I was just glad to make a match out of it," Trump said to the BBC.
            "It's been a pleasure to share a table with him.
            <br />
            <br />
            "It's an amazing achievement and he's the best player of all time -
            he keeps getting better and better. His determination and dedication
            are clear to see. He's been the best player in this tournament by
            quite a distance."
            <br />
            <br />
            O’Sullivan won his first world title in 2001, and since then he has
            been a force to be reckoned with. Even though he considered
            retirement in 2011, he has turned his form around and today, the
            Englishman has 39 ranking titles under his belt plus, a series of
            other astonishing achievements, making him truly one of the greatest
            of all time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Just at the Crucible, he’s broken a few records. O’Sullivan has won
            74 matches, made 199 centuries, won 1,182 frames and won the most
            amount of prize money - £3,061,700. These are some of his Crucible
            records but there are also a few left to break, including most
            maximums where he sits at 3 equalling with Stephen Hendry and most
            titles.
            <br />
            <br />
            Will he win his eighth Crucible title next year and break the
            record?
